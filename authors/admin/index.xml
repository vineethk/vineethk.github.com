      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Senior Scientist at GrammaTech, Inc. I am a Research Area Manager and lead a few research projects. I live in the lovely finger lakes region in upstate NY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GrammaTech, we work on several cool and cutting edge research projects: some of the projects we work on are listed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grammatech.com/sponsored-research&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We also have openings for researchers, software engineers, and interns (throughout the year). &lt;strong&gt;If what we do sounds interesting to you, and you would like to work with us or do an internship, drop me an email!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I was a graduate researcher at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Programming Languages Lab&lt;/a&gt;,  University of California Santa Barbara. My PhD advisor was &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ben Hardekopf&lt;/a&gt;. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, I was a research intern at Mozilla Research, working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/11/getting-to-know-dave-herman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dave Herman&lt;/a&gt;. I worked for a couple of years at National Instruments R&amp;amp;D, Bangalore, right after my undergrad (and developed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ni.com/tutorial/7386/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; LabVIEW feature).&lt;/p&gt;
