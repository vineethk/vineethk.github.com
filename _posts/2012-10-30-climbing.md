title: Climbing for Fitness

While there are several activities you can perform on a daily basis to keep yourself fit, I find climbing a fun way of keeping fit and challenging myself. It allows me to measure my progress quantitatively (I can also subjectively know when I climb a route better). It requires me to devote everything I have, it needs mental toughness, an ability to just trust yourself and let go. With all this, it has turned into my favorite sport. 

UCSB offers a "climbing for fitness" class, where you are taught some fitness exercises, climbing techniques, and climbing tips. If you are around in this area, I highly recommend the course. 

[Mohit Tiwari](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~tiwari/) recommended [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0811733394/) book for understanding the principles behind climbing and getting better at it. I also found [this](http://climbstrong.wordpress.com/) blog on climbing tips and techniques, and it seems interesting after having just taken a quick glance through it.
