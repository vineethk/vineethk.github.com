title: "[Collection]: Useful Git links"
---

Git is a neat revision control tool, but I often forget how to do certain things, and end up searching for the same links again and again. So I have put up a collection of links related to git, which I will keep updating as and when there is something interesting to add (I used google bookmarks for such things before, but sometime recently they decided to merge all the lists into one single list, making it almost unusable). 

* [Creating a local branch and merging][1]
* [Pushing a local branch to a remote repository, and checking out a branch from a remote repository][2]
* [Creating a remote "bare" repository][3]
