title: Download Manager is now a Panel in Firefox 14
comments: true

This is perhaps a hidden feature that many don't know about: Firefox 14 can be setup to make download manager as a panel rather than its own small window. 
I definitely like the new panel, unfortunately, its not on by default (you still get the old separate window for managing downloads).
Here is what you need to get the new download panel:

1. Update/Install Firefox 14. 
2. Type in `about:config` in the browser's URL field. 
3. You might get a warning `This might void your warranty!`. Promise them that you will be careful.
4. Search for the preference `browser.download.useToolkitUI`, and set it to `false`. 

There you go! Download something, and see the cool new download manager panel in action.
