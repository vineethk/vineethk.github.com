title: [HOWTO:] Running remote experiments
comments: true
---

This is one of those blogs that I write to remind myself of things that I tend to forget. One useful feature to use when running experiments remotely is to use the `screen` command, so that one can detach from a screen and reattach to it later. This is useful when I need to disconnect from the shell (or perhaps, my connectivity is not guaranteed to be on always).

The web page linked [here](https://spaces.seas.harvard.edu/display/USERDOCS/How+to+use+%27screen%27+for+remote+shell+sessions) gives a very useful guide of how to do this.
